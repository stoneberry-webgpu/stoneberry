Example code for stoneberry documentation.

* The example code source files are imported explicitly by the doc-site .mdx files.
* The packaged build contains utilities used by the example code. 
* There's a local dev build as well, not used for the site, but handy for quickly 
  iterating while developing on sample code without bothering with docusaurus.
